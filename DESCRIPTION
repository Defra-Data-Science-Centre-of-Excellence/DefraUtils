Description: The DefraUtils package contains a variety of functions that
 that could be useful for a variety of analysts within Defra. These include 
 functions to standardise our ways of working (e.g. project templates) and
 improve consistency in our approaches (e.g. to rounding). This is an open
 project and all Defra users should feel free to contribute any functions
 they think will be of wider use to defra.
