\description{
When a survey, such as the Farm Business Survey, requires all answers to be
input as numbers, a geometric sequence (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc.) is used to code
multiple choice answers.
For example, the respondent choosing the first (code 1) and third (code 4)
options would be input as 5.
This method means that any combination of choices can be decoded into its
constituent parts.
This function decodes these answers by taking an input column of values and
returning separate values for each answer.
